# Linux command line chat application

## About

This is a simple chat application to be used on Linux machines. This chat has no gui and is instead compiled, run, and used on the command prompt. At the minimum, this application requires a host and a server. These can be on different machines or the same machine. The files for both the host and the server implementation are in their respective folders. I made this program near the start of my interest in network programing, and I used a Linux virtual machine on my universities mainframe. Unfortunantly, since graduating, I no longer have access to the mainframe and thus am unable to make changes or improvements to the program. The program will run, but there are some amateurish issues with the design that I should address. So, since I cannot make adjustments, I will use this program as an example of how *not* to design a network oriented program.

## Usage

These files can be compiled using the GNU Compiler Collection (g++) and then run from a Linux machine. However, before compilation, the correct ports as well as IP addresses need to be configured
